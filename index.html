   <h2>The webpage uses tablets that lets the actors touch the name of the character they are playing so they can highlight their lines to make it easier to rehearse.</h2>
   <h3>Alderona is a scripted scifi scene for two teenagers, 1 guy and 1 girl.  ALDERONA and KLUDO brother/sister have secret powers meant to protect and save people’s lives.  
       Alderona is doubting her ability to carry out her responsibility and she discusses the issue with her brother:</h3>
 <div id="play">  
<p><span data-actor="alderona">Alderona:  I do not know how to tell father that I no longer wish to hold onto my spirit power.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="kludo">Kludo: Whatever do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="alderona">Alderona: I do not want this, this gift as it’s called.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="kludo">Kludo: Alderona, give it time…I have also gone through a difficult time with mine.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="alderona">Alderona: I don’t want it, Kludo, I’ve thought about it.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="kludo">Kludo: Have you already made your decision, Alderona?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="alderona">Alderona: I believe I have.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="kludo">Kludo: Have you spoken to anyone else about this?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="alderona">Alderona: No!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="kludo">Kludo: How long have you been debating this?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="alderona">Alderona: Months. It’s too much to handle.  I want to be normal, like everyone else.  I don’t want to keep this secret inside of me anymore.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="kludo">Kludo: Why not decide to never use your power only?  Why must you have it removed and erased?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="alderona">Alderona: I want to disconnect from it entirely, it consumes so much of my thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="dad">Dad: Hi guys, I heard it all! Alderona, Give it time.  Please. For me, give it time. I will support you but you must be sure before making such a decision!</span></p>
